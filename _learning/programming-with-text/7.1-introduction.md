This video introduces Session 7: Context-Free Grammar from the ITP course "Programming from A to Z".  A Context-Free Grammar is a set of recursive "replacement" rules to generate text. In this session, I discuss two JavaScript libraries: Tracery and RiTa.js for working with context-free grammars.  Finally, I code from scratch basic context-free grammar system.
