This is it! The conclusion to the "Build Your Own API" with node.js tutorial from my "Programming from A to Z" ITP class.

In this last part, I add AFINN-111 Sentiment Analysis to the API and setup an HTTP POST Method for users to submit data. I also add the node packages "cors" for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and "body-parser" to help with parsing the body of a POST request.
