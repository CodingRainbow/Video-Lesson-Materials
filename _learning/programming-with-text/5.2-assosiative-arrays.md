In this video, I discuss the concept of "associative arrays" in JavaScript.  I look at how JavaScript objects are collections of name-value (or key-value) pairs.  This works in much the same as dictionaries in Python or HashMaps in Java.  This concecpt will come extremely handy in the coding challenges around word counting.
