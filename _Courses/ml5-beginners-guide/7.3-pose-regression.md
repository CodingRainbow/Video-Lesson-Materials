This tutorial builds on the previous video combining PoseNet and ml5.neuralNetwork(). Once again, the output of the pre-trained model (the "pose" itself) is the input to an ml5.js neural network. However, this time the final output is a regression (3 continuous values) instead of classification. #machinelearning #ml5js #p5js
