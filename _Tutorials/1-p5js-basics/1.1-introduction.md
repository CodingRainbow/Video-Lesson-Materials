In this video, I talk about p5.js.  What is it? What can you do with it? Where did it come from? What is its relationship with Processing? p5.js is both a library for JavaScript and a beginner-friendly editor where you can build creative computational projects in the browser. It can be used for art, data visualization, and websites alongside other tools like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
