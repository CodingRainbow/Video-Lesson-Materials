Welcome to Snake Game. <br> <br>
White is snake. Red is food. Gray is wall, and so are the borders. <br> <br>
Some evil punishments will come if you don't eat any food for too long. 
If you haven't eat any food for 5 seconds, the food will go away. 
If you haven't eat for 15 seconds, the wall will come towards you. 
If you haven't eat for 30 seconds, the snake will be accelerated, and you will be taken 200 points off.
<br> <br> So go eat the food! <br> <br>
Besides being punished, you can speed the snake up voluntarily by continuously pressing the same arrow key 2 times.
