## Contributing to The Coding Train

Contributions to this repository encouraged! We're all learning so mistakes and confusion are welcome, we're here to help and try to make contributing as friendly and accessible as possible.

Here are the type of contributions we are looking for:
 - bug-fixes
 - making the code easier to read
 - adding a link to your creative version
 - website design improvements
 - adding any missing content

The code in the repository should match the code written 
in the YouTube tutorials, so that fellow passengers can  
use this code as a base for their own implementations.

To make a contribution, fork this repository and create a pull request.
Please try to **include a link to a running demo** (or video / gif / 
screen capture) in the pull request's description. This makes it easy to 
quickly view the contribution and provide feedback!

If you are just editing a single file, you may click the pencil when viewing
the file to edit in the browser.

If you are unsure about git and GitHub, and how to make your contribution,
you should watch [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Happy Coding!
