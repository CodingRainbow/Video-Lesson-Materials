## Contributing to Rainbow-Code

Contributions to this repository are very welcome!

Here are the type of contributions we are looking for:
 - bug-fixes
 - making the code easier to read
 - adding a link to your modification of the challenge/code 
  into the README.md of the relevant folder.

This is because the code in the repository should match the code written 
in the YouTube tutorials, so that fellow Rainbow Coders can then 
use this code as a base for their own implementations.

To make your contribution, fork this repository and make a pull request.
Please make sure to **include a link to your running example** in the pull
request's description so I can check our your version right away.
If you are just editing a single file, you may click the pencil when viewing
the file to edit in the browser.

If you are unsure about git and GitHub, and how to make your contribution,
you should watch [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Happy Rainbow Coding!
